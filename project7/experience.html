    <h1 id="main" class="first">My Personal Experience</h1>
    <p class="second">I worked at Salem Hyde Elementary School in Northside Syracuse and was placed within a second-grade classroom. I worked in the same classroom with the same 25 students on Mondays, Wednesday, and Fridays. I helped assist the primary teacher with group lessons and worked individually with students and in small groups. There were two students I worked with in a small group or individually every day I went in. We worked on more basic literacy concepts, such as the letters of the alphabet and sight words. One of the students I worked with daily struggled with English more because she was born in Syria and raised in Turkey, so her first language was Kurdish. The other student was held back for 2 years due to his lack of attendance and his struggles with literacy.  </p>

            <h1>Responsibilities</h1>
            <p>I am responsible for providing literacy support to students, so that includes working one on one, in small groups, and helping with classroom activities. I go with the students to their “specials” which were physical education, art class, and the library. I help students with all subjects, including math, English, reading, science, and even history. I primarily offer support with English though. Maintaining open communication with my supervisor, the teacher’s whose classroom in which I was placed, and the other teaching assistant within that classroom. I am expected to communicate concerns or conflicts to the Shaw Center, teachers, and my site supervisor. I am responsible for managing conflict with the students as well. In this program, SULC tutors are expected to maintain a certain degree of professionalism. This includes always being in uniform and having a nametag that identifies your association with the SULC.  </p>
            <h1>Language and Disabilities</h1>
            <p>I provided literacy support to many students whose first language was not English. Some of the students first languages in my classroom included Swahili, Kurdish, Arabic, and Spanish. English Language Learner students represented 17% of SCSD students (NYSED, 2022). This is due to an increase of refugees accepted by the city of Syracuse. The Syracuse University Literacy Corps program exposed me to students of varying economic, social, and cultural backgrounds. The experience of working with students whose first languages were Swahili, Arabic, Spanish, and Kurdish, allowed me to better understand the potential barriers these students face in the classroom. Also, students with disabilities in the SCSD make up 21% of the student population (NYSED, 2023). These disabilities include ADD, ADHD, dyslexia, and more. </p>

            <h1>Transportation</h1>
            <p>One benefit of this job opportunity was that free transportation was provided for all the employees. A shuttle was provided approximately thirty minutes before each shift. One of the cons of this program is that shifts are often during the hours of 8am to 3pm because that is when school is in session. There are a few site placements that are at night, but at my location I had to go in between the hours of 8am to 3pm. This made it a bit harder for me to create a schedule for my courses at Syracuse University.</p>
            <h1>Reflections and Trainings </h1>
            <p>The Syracuse University Literacy Corps program is a reciprocal one. That said, the program required SULC tutors to fill out worksheets summarizing their actions throughout their shift and to write an in-person reflection. It also required tutors to attend different training courses. Last semester, I attended the Black History Month training, in which we learned more about Black culture and history. On the daily reflections, I detailed the class activities I helped with and when I worked individually or in small groups with students. This allowed me to better track the progress of the students I worked with and to remember which concepts I needed to practice more with them. At the end of the semester, I did a tutor report which focused on civic and global responsibility, communication skills, critical thinking, and commitment to diversity and inclusion. Not only did it allow me to do good for others, but it also provided me with a new outlet to learn more about myself and my role as a global citizen. Syracuse University Literacy Corps program is an integrated learning program that encourages the tutors to reflect on their own learning through their time and experiences at their sites.  </p>
