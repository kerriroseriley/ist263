    <h1>The History of Literacy Corps</h1>
    <p>The Syracuse University Literacy Corps program was founded in 1997 and was born from President Clinton’s “America Reads Challenge,” which encouraged communities to help improve literacy rates through tutoring. The program was created as a response to Clinton’s call for college students to help increase literacy rates within their own communities. The program was launched by Pamela K. Heintz, who is the Associate Vice President for Engagement and Director of the Mary Ann Shaw Center for Public and Community Service. Originally, the program only had 15 tutors placed around the Syracuse School District. More than 200 students participate in the program each semester and accumulate over 30,000 hours of academic support in different schools and afterschool programs. Tutors provide literacy support for students in the Syracuse City School District, Syracuse Catholic Schools, Solvay Union Free School District, East Syracuse School District, Syracuse Academy of Science Charter Schools, and Syracuse-area community-based organizations. Currently, SULC tutors work at over 25 different sites. In 1999, the Gary and Karen B Winnick Foundation gifted the program to help expand the number of tutors and sites. In 2005, Syracuse University collaborated with Say Yes to Education and the Syracuse City School District to pilot the Syracuse Say Yes to Education and Economic Development Demonstration Program. As of now, the Division of Academic Affairs provides administrative funding and support for SULC as well as the contributions of other benefactors such as the Gettinger Family Foundation. </p>

    <h1>The Importance of Literacy</h1>
    <p>Literacy is important, because being literate is an empowering life skill that can help increase job opportunities for individuals and enrich their education. Illiteracy in adulthood can have major health impacts, such as higher rates of mortality, poorer management of chronic disease, and increased rates of hospitalization (Pignone & Dewalt, 2006). In the Syracuse City School District, there are higher rates of poverty which correlates directly to literacy and academic achievement.  </p>

    <h1>My Experience</h1>
    <p>As we reflect on the history and impact of Literacy Corps, we can also look at the personal experiences of participants of the program. </p>

    <h1>Developed Skills</h1>
    <p>Literacy Corps allows students to master the skills of collaboration, problem solving, leadership, communication, and time management. </p>>
